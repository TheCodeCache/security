# What is an SSL?  
SSL is a protocol that secures the communication between client and server using `public key`  
â€ƒand `symmetric key cryptography authentication` technology.  

# SSL Certificate
An SSL certificate is a digitally secured file which contains information about the organization with a crypto key.  
When we install an SSL Certificate on the server, the browser running the website will recognize the organization's information, which is stored in the SSL certificate, and display the secured URL as "(HTTPS://) with Green Pad-Lock".  

# Types of SSL Certificates
1. SSL Certificates for Website
2. SSL Certificates for MIME/SMIME
3. SSL Certificate for IP Address
4. Code Signing Certificate to secure Software/Application/Files
