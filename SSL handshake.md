# SSL/TLS handshake  
The SSL/TLS handshake involves a series of steps  
  through which both the parties – client and server, `validate` and start communicating through the secure `SSL/TLS tunnel`.  

**Client:** "Hello there. I want to establish secure communication between the two of us. Here are my cipher suits and compatible SSL/TLS version."  

**Server:** "Hello Client. I have checked your cipher suits and SSL/TLS version.  
  I think we're good to go ahead. Here are my certificate file and my public key. Check 'em out."  

**Client:** "Let me verify your certificate. (After a while) Okay, it seems fine, but I need to verify your private key.  
  What I'll do is, I will generate and encrypt a pre-master (shared secret key) key using your public key.  
  Decrypt it using your private key and we’ll use thing master key to encrypt and decrypt the information"  

**Server:** "Done."  

> Now that both the parties know who they’re talking to, the information transferred between them will be secured using the master-key. Keep in mind that once the verification part is over, the encryption takes place through the master-key only. This is symmetric encryption.

Client: "I’m sending you this sample message to verify that our master-key works.  
  Send me the decrypted version of this message. If it works, our data is in safe hands."

Server: "Yeah, it works. I think we’ve accomplished what we were looking for."
