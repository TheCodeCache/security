# Common Authentication Methods

To authenticate a user accessing the application or a system, we've several commonly used methods as follows:  

1. Token authentication:  
  A protocol that allows users to verify themselves and receive a token in return.  
  They can then access the website or app as long as that token is valid.  
2. Password authentication:  
  The most common form of authentication  
3. Biometric authentication:  
  It verifies an individual based on their unique biological characteristics. There are different forms of it  
  - Face Match  
  - Finger-print scanners  
  - Voice recognition  
  - Eye scanners  
4. Multi-Factor Authentication:  
  This system requires users to provide two or more verification factors to get access  
5. Certificate-based Authentication:  
  This form of authentication uses a digital certificate to identify a user before accessing a resource.  
  We can use this solution for all endpoints - users, devices, machines, etc.  
  This is what makes this form of authentication unique.  
  Most of the certificate-based authentication solutions come with cloud-based management platforms,  
  that make it easier for administrators to manage, monitor and issue the new certificates for their employees.
